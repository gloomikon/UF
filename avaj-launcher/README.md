# avaj-launcher
The task of project is to implement a minimal aircraft simulation program based on a given
`UML` class diagram. The `Unified Modeling Language` is used in software engineering
for visualizing the design of an application. It offers programmers a standardized way of
thinking about Object Oriented software, before writing any line of code.
