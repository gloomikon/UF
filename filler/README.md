# Filler
`Filler` is an algorithmic game which consists in filling a grid of a known size in advance  
with pieces of random size and shapes, without the pieces being stacked more than one  
square above each other and without them exceeding the grid. If one of these conditions  
is not met, the game stops.  
  
Each successfully placed piece yields a number of points, and has only one player, the  
goal of the game could be to get the best score possible. However, it is with two players  
that the filler takes all his interest. Each player has for the purpose of placing as many  
pieces as possible while attempting to prevent his opponent from doing the same. At the  
end of the game, the one with the most points wins the match...
