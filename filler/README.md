# Filler
`Filler` is an algorithmic game which consists in filling a grid of a known size in advance  
with pieces of random size and shapes, without the pieces being stacked more than one

pieces as possible while attempting to prevent his opponent from doing the same. At the  
end of the game, the one with the most points wins the match...
