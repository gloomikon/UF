# Get_next_line
The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line  
ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.  

Thanks to the project `get_next_line`, you will finally be able to write a function  
that will allow you to read a line ending with a newline character from a file descriptor.  
Youâ€™ll be able to add this function to your `libft` if you feel like it and most importantly,  
use it in all the future projects that will require it.
